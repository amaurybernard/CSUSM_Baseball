\f0\fs24 \cf0 The target user for our game will be users in the age range 11-18. This is the typical age range of middle school and high school students. The game itself will be simple so that, realistically, any age group would be able to easily open up the app and play, however, when designing the game we will focus on the 11-18 age group.\
\
The game is a batting simulator so our our expected users will be baseball fans.}
